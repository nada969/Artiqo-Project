🎨 Artiqo: Where Local Talent Meets Digital Magic
🌟 Project Name:
Artiqo – The Artsy Marketplace for Local Legends

📌 What’s This All About?
Artiqo is your go-to online marketplace that connects local artists (aka creative geniuses) with awesome buyers who love unique, handmade goods. 🎁 Whether you're here to sell your soul on canvas or snag some rare art for your wall, Artiqo makes it smooth with features like secure logins, organized product listings, a chill cart system, and safe payments. 🎨🛒💳

✨ What Makes Artiqo Shine?
- User Roles – Artists do the uploading, buyers do the buying. Everyone wins!
- Product Listings – Artists can add, tweak, or remove their masterpieces.
- Cart System – Add it, update it, buy it—your cart, your rules.
- Order Management – Keep tabs on your past and present purchases.
- Payments – Smooth, secure, and with status updates so you know what’s up.
- Artist Profiles – Each artist gets their own artsy corner of the platform to flex their skills and tell their story.

🛠️ Tech Behind the Magic
- Backend: Python (Django – solid, like your favorite sketchbook)
- Frontend: React.js (coming soon to a browser near you!)
- Database: MySQL (storing art data like it’s the Louvre)
- Authentication: JWT (for login that doesn’t mess around)
